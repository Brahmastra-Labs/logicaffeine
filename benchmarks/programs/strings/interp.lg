## To countSpaces (n: Int) -> Int:
    Let mutable result be "".
    Let mutable i be 0.
    While i is less than n:
        Set result to result + i + " ".
        Set i to i + 1.
    Let mutable spaces be 0.
    Let mutable j be 0.
    While j is less than the length of result:
        If item (j + 1) of result equals " ":
            Set spaces to spaces + 1.
        Set j to j + 1.
    Return spaces.

## Main
Show countSpaces(1000).
