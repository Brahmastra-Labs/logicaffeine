## Main
Let mutable count be 0.
Let mutable i be 2.
While i is at most 10000:
    Let mutable isPrime be 1.
    Let mutable d be 2.
    While d * d is at most i:
        If i % d equals 0:
            Set isPrime to 0.
            Set d to i.
        Set d to d + 1.
    If isPrime equals 1:
        Set count to count + 1.
    Set i to i + 1.
Show count.
