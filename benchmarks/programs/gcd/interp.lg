## To gcd (a: Int, b: Int) -> Int:
    Let mutable x be a.
    Let mutable y be b.
    While y is greater than 0:
        Let temp be y.
        Set y to x % y.
        Set x to temp.
    Return x.

## Main
Let mutable sum be 0.
Let mutable i be 1.
While i is at most 500:
    Let mutable j be i.
    While j is at most 500:
        Set sum to sum + gcd(i, j).
        Set j to j + 1.
    Set i to i + 1.
Show sum.
