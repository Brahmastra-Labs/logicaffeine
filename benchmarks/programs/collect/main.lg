## To native parseInt (s: Text) -> Int

## Main
Let arguments be args().
Let n be parseInt(item 2 of arguments).
Let mutable m be a new Map of Int to Int with capacity n.
Let mutable i be 1.
While i is less than n + 1:
    Set item i of m to i * 2.
    Set i to i + 1.
Let mutable found be 0.
Set i to 1.
While i is less than n + 1:
    If item i of m equals i * 2:
        Set found to found + 1.
    Set i to i + 1.
Show found.
