## To benchmark (n: Int) -> Int:
    Let mutable m be a new Map of Int to Int.
    Let mutable i be 1.
    While i is less than n + 1:
        Set item i of m to i * 2.
        Set i to i + 1.
    Let mutable found be 0.
    Set i to 1.
    While i is less than n + 1:
        If item i of m equals i * 2:
            Set found to found + 1.
        Set i to i + 1.
    Return found.

## Main
Show benchmark(1000).
