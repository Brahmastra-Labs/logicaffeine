# LOGICAFFEINE

> Debug your thoughts. Turn everyday English into rigorous First-Order Logic.

## What is LOGICAFFEINE?

LOGICAFFEINE is an English-to-First-Order-Logic transpiler and full programming language. It parses natural language sentences and outputs formal logic formulas in Unicode or LaTeX notation, and extends into a complete imperative language with CRDT-based distributed systems, formal verification, and more.

The tool helps users:
- Debug arguments and reasoning with formal logic
- Learn formal logic interactively through a gamified curriculum
- Verify logical structures with Z3-powered proof assistance
- Translate between natural language and formal notation
- Write full programs in English that compile to Rust/WASM

## Key Features

### Natural Language to Logic
Parse English sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL). Handles 53+ linguistic phenomena including quantifiers, connectives, predicates, tense, aspect, modal logic, and more.

Example:
- Input: "All humans are mortal"
- Output: ∀x(Human(x) → Mortal(x))

### Multiple Output Formats
- Unicode symbols (∀, ∃, →, ∧, ∨, ¬)
- LaTeX notation (\forall, \exists, \rightarrow)
- Simple FOL representation

### Interactive Learning Platform
Progressive curriculum from basic syllogisms to advanced modal logic. Gamified with XP, streaks, achievements, and adaptive difficulty. Four eras covering 20+ modules.

### Studio Playground
Real-time translation with three modes:
- **Logic Mode**: English to FOL with AST visualization
- **Code Mode**: Imperative LOGOS programs with REPL and Rust codegen
- **Math Mode**: Vernacular theorem proving with tactic guidance

### Full Programming Language
LOGOS extends beyond logic into a complete language with:
- Functions, structs, enums, pattern matching
- Refinement types and generics
- Channels, actors, structured concurrency
- CRDTs for distributed systems
- Capability-based security with English policy blocks
- Curry-Howard proof assistant with Z3 verification

### Package Registry
Community-contributed logic modules and packages. GitHub OAuth for publishing.
