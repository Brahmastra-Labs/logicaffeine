# LOGICAFFEINE

> Turn everyday English into rigorous First-Order Logic

## What is LOGICAFFEINE?

LOGICAFFEINE is an English-to-First-Order-Logic transpiler. It parses natural language sentences and outputs formal logic formulas in Unicode or LaTeX notation.

The tool helps users:
- Debug arguments and reasoning
- Learn formal logic interactively
- Verify logical structures
- Translate between natural language and formal notation

## Key Features

### Natural Language Parsing
Parse English sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL). Handle quantifiers, connectives, predicates, and more.

Example:
- Input: "All humans are mortal"
- Output: ∀x(Human(x) → Mortal(x))

### Multiple Output Formats
- Unicode symbols (∀, ∃, →, ∧, ∨, ¬)
- LaTeX notation (\forall, \exists, \rightarrow)
- Simple FOL representation

### Interactive Learning
Progressive curriculum from basic syllogisms to advanced modal logic. Exercises with immediate feedback and adaptive hints.

### Studio Playground
Real-time translation with syntax highlighting, AST visualization, and proof assistance.
