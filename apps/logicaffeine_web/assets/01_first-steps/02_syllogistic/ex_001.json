  "prompt": "You aren't the cleanest biologist.",
  "options": [
    "u is not B",
    "U is not b",
    "U is not B",
    "u is not b"

  "correct": 3,
  "hint": "Does the word 'You' refer to a vast group of people, or a specific person standing right here?",
  "explanation": "\"You\" refers to a specific individual (the listener), so we use lowercase \"u\". The phrase \"the cleanest biologist\" also picks out a specific individual (like saying \"the tallest person\"), so we use lowercase \"b\". In logic, lowercase = specific individual, UPPERCASE = a class or category of things.",
  "visual_concept": "Two sizes: lowercase letters are single people (you can point at them), UPPERCASE letters are groups/crowds inside circles (you point at the whole group)."
