  "prompt": "All detectives in London hate people who are frantic.",
  "options": [
    "all H is D",
    "all D is H",
    "all d is H",
    "D is H"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Who is doing the hating here? The detectives or the frantic people? In 'all X is Y', X is the subject doing/being something.",
  "explanation": "Think of it as a claim about EVERY detective: 'Take any detective — that detective hates frantic people.' The subject (D for Detectives) comes first, the predicate (H for Haters-of-frantic-people) comes second. We use uppercase because we're talking about classes of people, not specific individuals like 'Sherlock'."
