  "prompt": "\"God\" means \"object of ultimate concern\".",
  "options": [
    "Too broad",
    "Too narrow",
    "Circular",
    "Uses poorly understood terms",
    "Poor match in vagueness",
    "Poor match in emotional tone",
    "Has non-essential properties"
  ],
  "correct": 0,
  "hint": "Could someone's 'object of ultimate concern' be something other than God? What about career, family, or money?",
  "explanation": "This definition is TOO BROAD. Many people's 'object of ultimate concern' might be their family, their nation, or even their career — but we wouldn't call those things 'God'. The definition captures too many things that don't fit the term. It fails to pick out what's distinctive about the concept of God."
