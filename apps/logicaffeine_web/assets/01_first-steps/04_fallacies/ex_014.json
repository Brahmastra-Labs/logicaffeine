  "hint": "This combines resistance to change with the assumption that tradition equals correctness.",
  "explanation": "This combines Appeal to Tradition (assuming old ways are correct) with Status Quo Bias (preferring the current state simply because it's current). Neither provides actual reasons why the current approach is better than alternatives.",
