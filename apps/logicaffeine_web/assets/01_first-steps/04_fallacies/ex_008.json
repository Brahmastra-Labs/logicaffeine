    "Red Herring",

  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Notice how the conclusion and the premise are saying the same thing in different words.",
  "explanation": "This is Circular Reasoning (also called Begging the Question) - the conclusion is simply restating the premise. 'Murder is wrong' and 'killing people is immoral' mean essentially the same thing, so the argument provides no actual justification.",
