  "hint": "This argument attacks the person making the claim rather than the claim itself.",
  "explanation": "This is an Ad Hominem fallacy - attacking John's character (his high school grades) instead of addressing his actual argument about climate change. A person's past academic performance doesn't automatically invalidate their current opinions.",
