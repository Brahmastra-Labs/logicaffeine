  "hint": "This argument exploits the fact that a word has multiple meanings.",
  "explanation": "This is Equivocation - using a word with multiple meanings and shifting between them mid-argument. 'Bank' can mean a financial institution OR a riverbank. The argument sneakily switches definitions to reach an absurd conclusion.",
