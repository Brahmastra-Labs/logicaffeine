  "prompt": "To survey student opinions, you only ask students in the library at 2am. What problem affects your sample?",
  "options": [
    "Sample is too large",
    "Selection bias",
    "Confirmation bias",
    "Circular reasoning"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Who studies in the library at 2am? Are they representative of all students?",
  "explanation": "This is selection bias - your sample isn't representative. Students at the library at 2am are probably more studious, more stressed about exams, or have different schedules than average students. A good sample should represent the whole population you're studying.",
  "visual_concept": "Sampling: Trying to learn about fish in a pond but only fishing at the surface. You'll miss all the bottom-dwellers!"
