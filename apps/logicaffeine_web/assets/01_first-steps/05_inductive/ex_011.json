  "hint": "We're inferring something about others based on similarity to ourselves.",
  "explanation": "This is the classic argument from analogy for other minds. We observe that others behave similarly to us, and since we know our similar behavior is caused by having a mind, we infer they probably have minds too. It's philosophically significant but not deductively certain.",
  "visual_concept": "Looking in a mirror: If I wince when hurt and so do you, and MY wincing comes from feeling pain, YOUR wincing probably does too."
