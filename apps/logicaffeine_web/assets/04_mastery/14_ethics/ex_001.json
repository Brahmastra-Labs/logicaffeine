  "options": [
    "Time and tense",
    "Obligation, permission, and prohibition",
    "Knowledge and belief",
    "Possibility and necessity"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "The Greek 'deon' means 'that which is binding' - duty.",
  "explanation": "Deontic logic formalizes normative concepts: Obligatory (O), Permitted (P), Forbidden (F). Just as modal logic has □ for necessity, deontic logic has O for 'it ought to be that'. This allows rigorous analysis of moral and legal reasoning.",
  "visual_concept": "O(p) = it's obligatory that p. P(p) = it's permitted that p. F(p) = it's forbidden that p. Ethics becomes formal!"
