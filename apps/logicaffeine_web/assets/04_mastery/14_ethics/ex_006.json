  "prompt": "In deontic logic, what is the 'ought-can' principle?",
  "options": [
    "You can do whatever you ought to do",
    "Impossible actions cannot be obligatory",
    "Obligations create abilities",
    "Permission implies possibility"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "'Ought implies can' - a constraint on meaningful obligations.",
  "explanation": "The ought-can principle states O(p) → ◇p (ought implies can/possible). You cannot be obligated to do the impossible. If flying unaided is impossible, you can't be obligated to fly. This constrains what counts as a genuine obligation.",
  "visual_concept": "No one has a duty to turn lead into gold - it's impossible. Real obligations must be achievable."
