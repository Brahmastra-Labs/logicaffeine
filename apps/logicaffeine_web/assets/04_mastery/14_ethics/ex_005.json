  "prompt": "What is the relationship between F(p) and O(¬p)?",
  "options": [
    "They are contradictory",
    "They are equivalent",
    "F(p) implies O(¬p) but not vice versa",
    "They are unrelated concepts"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Forbidden means obligated not to do.",
  "explanation": "F(p) ≡ O(¬p): Something being forbidden is equivalent to its negation being obligatory. If lying is forbidden, then not-lying is obligatory. Similarly, P(p) ≡ ¬O(¬p): permission is absence of obligation to the contrary.",
  "visual_concept": "Forbidden = must not. Obligatory = must. So forbidden(p) = must(not-p). Different words, same logical content."
