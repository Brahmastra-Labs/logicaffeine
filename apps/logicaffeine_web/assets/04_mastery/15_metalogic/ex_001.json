    "Every valid argument can be proven",
    "Every provable argument is valid",
    "The system has no contradictions",
    "The system is complete"

  "hint": "Soundness is about the proof system not proving false things.",
  "explanation": "Soundness: If ⊢ φ (φ is provable) then ⊨ φ (φ is valid). The proof system never lies - it only proves things that are actually true. Sound systems are trustworthy: a proof guarantees truth.",
  "visual_concept": "Soundness: Everything inside the 'provable' circle is also inside the 'true' circle. We never prove false things."
