  "options": [
    "Every provable argument is valid",
    "Every valid argument can be proven",
    "The system has all possible rules",
    "The system can express everything"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Completeness is about the proof system being able to prove all true things.",
  "explanation": "Completeness: If ⊨ φ (φ is valid) then ⊢ φ (φ is provable). Every truth can be proven. Complete systems miss nothing - if it's true, you can prove it. First-order logic is complete (Gödel 1929).",
  "visual_concept": "Completeness: Everything inside the 'true' circle is also inside the 'provable' circle. No truths escape our proof system."
