  "prompt": "What is the semantic value 'true in all models' called?",
  "options": [
    "Soundness",
    "Validity",
    "Consistency",
    "Provability"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "This is a semantic notion - about truth in interpretations, not about proofs.",
  "explanation": "Validity (⊨): A formula is valid if it's true in every possible model/interpretation. Validity is a semantic notion. Compare: Provability (⊢) is a syntactic notion - derivable using inference rules.",
  "visual_concept": "Validity: Try every possible world. If the formula is true in ALL of them, it's valid. Like 'P ∨ ¬P' - true no matter what P means."
