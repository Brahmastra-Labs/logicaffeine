  "options": [
    "The law of identity",
    "Classical bivalence (true/false only)",
    "The law of double negation",
    "Modal logic"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "If it's true, it's false; if it's false, it's true. What third option exists?",
  "explanation": "The liar paradox challenges bivalence: if 'This sentence is false' is true, then it's false; if false, then true. Some responses: it's neither true nor false (gaps), it's both (gluts), or it's meaningless. This has driven development of non-classical logics.",
  "visual_concept": "Classical logic: every proposition is true or false. The liar seems to be neither - or both. A crack in the foundation?"
