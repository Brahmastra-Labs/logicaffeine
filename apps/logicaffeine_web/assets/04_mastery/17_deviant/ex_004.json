  "options": [
    "Law of identity",
    "Law of non-contradiction",
    "Law of excluded middle",
    "Transitivity"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "These logics allow contradictions without everything becoming provable.",
  "explanation": "Paraconsistent logics reject ex falso quodlibet (from a contradiction, anything follows). They allow inconsistent but non-trivial theories - useful for reasoning with contradictory information, like legal databases or evolving scientific theories where contradictions exist but we still need to reason.",
  "visual_concept": "Classical: one contradiction, and EVERYTHING is true (explosion). Paraconsistent: contradictions are contained, reasoning continues."
