  "prompt": "What rule allows us to derive ¬P from (P → Q) and ¬Q?",
  "options": [
    "Modus Ponens",
    "Modus Tollens",
    "Contraposition",
    "Double Negation"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "This rule 'denies the consequent' to deny the antecedent.",
  "explanation": "Modus Tollens (MT): From (P → Q) and ¬Q, derive ¬P. If P implies Q, but Q is false, then P must be false too. This is the contrapositive of Modus Ponens.",
