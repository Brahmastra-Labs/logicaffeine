  "options": [
    "From (P ∨ Q) and ¬P, derive Q",
    "From (P → Q) and (R → S) and (P ∨ R), derive (Q ∨ S)",
    "From (P → Q) and (Q → R), derive (P → R)",
    "From P and Q, derive (P ∧ Q)"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "This rule combines two conditionals with a disjunction.",
  "explanation": "Constructive Dilemma (CD): From (P → Q), (R → S), and (P ∨ R), derive (Q ∨ S). If either P or R is true, and P leads to Q while R leads to S, then either Q or S must be true.",
  "visual_concept": "Two roads diverge: Left path (P) leads to Q, right path (R) leads to S. If you must take one path (P ∨ R), you'll reach Q or S."
