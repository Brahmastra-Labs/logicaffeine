  "prompt": "According to Russell, \"The king of France is bald\" is:",
  "options": [
    "True",
    "False",
    "Neither true nor false",
    "Meaningless"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Russell analyzed definite descriptions as existence claims. Does the king of France exist?",
  "explanation": "Russell's Theory of Descriptions: 'The F is G' = ∃x(Fx ∧ ∀y(Fy → y=x) ∧ Gx). There exists exactly one F, and it is G. Since no king of France exists, the existence claim fails, making the whole sentence FALSE (not meaningless).",
  "visual_concept": "\"The king of France is bald\" secretly claims: (1) There IS a king of France, (2) There's only ONE, (3) He's bald. Step 1 fails → whole thing false."
