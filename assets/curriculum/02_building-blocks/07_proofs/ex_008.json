  "options": [
    "¬P ∧ ¬Q",
    "¬P ∨ ¬Q",
    "P ∨ Q",
    "¬(P ∨ Q)"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "De Morgan 'flips' the connective and distributes the negation.",
  "explanation": "De Morgan's Law: ¬(P ∧ Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ ¬Q). Not-both is equivalent to at-least-one-not. Similarly, ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ (¬P ∧ ¬Q). The negation 'swaps' AND/OR and negates both parts.",
  "visual_concept": "It's NOT true that (it's sunny AND warm) = It's not sunny OR it's not warm. Breaking the 'and' becomes an 'or'."
