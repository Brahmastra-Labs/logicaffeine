  "explanation": "A branch with a contradiction (P and ¬P) is CLOSED, marked with ×. This shows that particular combination of assumptions leads to impossibility. If ALL branches close, the original argument is valid.",
  "visual_concept": "Truth tree branches are paths. A contradiction is a dead end - mark it with × and stop exploring that path."
