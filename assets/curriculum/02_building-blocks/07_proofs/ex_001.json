    "Modus Tollens",
    "Modus Ponens",
    "Hypothetical Syllogism",

  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "This is the most basic rule for conditionals - 'affirming the antecedent'.",
  "explanation": "Modus Ponens (MP): From P and (P → Q), derive Q. If we have P (the antecedent is true) and P implies Q, then Q must be true. This is the foundation of logical inference.",
  "visual_concept": "If it rains (P), the ground gets wet (Q). It's raining (P). Therefore? The ground is wet (Q)."
