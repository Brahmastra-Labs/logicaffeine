  "prompt": "Which equivalence rule shows that (P → Q) ≡ (¬P ∨ Q)?",
  "options": [
    "De Morgan's Law",
    "Material Implication",
    "Double Negation",
    "Contraposition"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "This rule defines implication in terms of disjunction and negation.",
  "explanation": "Material Implication: (P → Q) is logically equivalent to (¬P ∨ Q). 'If P then Q' means the same as 'Either not-P or Q'. Both are false only when P is true and Q is false.",
  "visual_concept": "Two ways to say the same thing: 'If it rains, I'll bring an umbrella' = 'Either it won't rain, or I'll bring an umbrella'."
