  "hint": "How many 'not's do you see in the sentence? Does each property get its own negation, or is the whole statement negated?",
  "explanation": "Count the negations: 'NOT mean' and 'NOT curious' — each property is individually negated. The 'either...or' connects these two negated properties. So we get (~M ∨ ~C): 'not-mean OR not-curious'. This is different from ~(M ∨ C) which would mean 'it's false that you're mean or curious' — a much stronger claim!"
