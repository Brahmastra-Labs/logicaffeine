  "hint": "What FOLLOWS from being smart? Is it just bashfulness, or is it the combination of bashfulness AND carefulness?",
  "explanation": "Think of it as a promise: 'IF you're smart, THEN you get BOTH bashful AND careful.' The consequence of being smart is the whole package (B · C), not just B alone. Compare option 2: '(S ⊃ B) · C' would mean 'Smart implies bashful, AND ALSO you're careful regardless' — that's a different claim! The parentheses show what belongs together."
