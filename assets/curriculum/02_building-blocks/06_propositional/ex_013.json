  "hint": "Is the 'or' part of what follows from the 'if', or a separate alternative?",
  "explanation": "In 'If X, then Y or Z', the disjunction is the consequence: X \u2283 (Y \u2228 Z). Being X leads to the choice between Y and Z. Compare to '(If X then Y) or Z' which would be (X \u2283 Y) \u2228 Z."
