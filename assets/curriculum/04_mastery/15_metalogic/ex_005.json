  "prompt": "A set of sentences is CONSISTENT if:",
  "options": [
    "All sentences are true",
    "The sentences don't contradict each other",
    "All sentences can be proven",
    "The sentences are valid"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Consistency is about avoiding contradiction.",
  "explanation": "A set Γ is consistent if there's no sentence φ such that Γ ⊢ φ and Γ ⊢ ¬φ. Equivalently, there exists a model satisfying all of Γ. Inconsistent sets prove everything (explosion principle).",
  "visual_concept": "Consistent: The sentences can all be true together in at least one possible world. Inconsistent: No possible world makes them all true."
