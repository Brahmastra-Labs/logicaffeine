  "hint": "If you ought to help the victim, do you thereby ought to (help or ignore)?",
  "explanation": "If O(p), then classically O(p ∨ q) for any q. But then 'You ought to help the robbery victim' implies 'You ought to (help the victim or commit robbery)'. This seems wrong - the disjunction shouldn't be obligatory! This shows deontic logic needs careful treatment.",
  "visual_concept": "Obligation seems to 'spread' illogically: O(help) → O(help ∨ rob). But surely you're not obligated to 'help or rob'!"
