  "prompt": "What is the 'sorites paradox' that motivates fuzzy logic?",
  "options": [
    "Self-referential statements cause contradictions",
    "Adding one grain doesn't make a heap, yet many grains do",
    "Some truths cannot be proven",
    "Time creates logical paradoxes"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "It involves vague predicates and seemingly valid reasoning that leads to absurdity.",
  "explanation": "The sorites (heap) paradox: 1 grain isn't a heap. Adding 1 grain to a non-heap doesn't make a heap. Therefore, no number of grains is a heap! The problem is vagueness - 'heap' has no sharp boundary. Fuzzy logic models this gradual transition.",
  "visual_concept": "1 grain: not a heap. 2 grains: not a heap. ... 1 million grains: still not a heap? The logic seems valid but the conclusion is absurd."
