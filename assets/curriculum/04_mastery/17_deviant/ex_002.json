  "options": [
    "Law of non-contradiction",
    "Law of excluded middle",
    "Modus ponens",

  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Intuitionists require constructive proofs - you must build what you claim exists.",
  "explanation": "Intuitionistic logic rejects the law of excluded middle (P ∨ ¬P). For intuitionists, a statement is only true if we can construct a proof; merely showing ¬P leads to contradiction doesn't prove P exists. This affects mathematics: you can't prove existence by contradiction alone.",
  "visual_concept": "Classical: 'Either there's a solution or there isn't.' Intuitionist: 'Show me the solution, or show me why it can't exist.'"
