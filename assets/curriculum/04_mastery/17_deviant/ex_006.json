    "Classical logic is too complex",
    "Classical implication allows irrelevant premises",
    "Classical logic can't handle time",
    "Classical negation is ambiguous"

  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "In classical logic, 'If the moon is cheese, then 2+2=4' is valid.",
  "explanation": "Relevance logic rejects paradoxes of material implication. Classically, P → Q is true whenever P is false - even if P and Q are completely unrelated! Relevance logic requires the antecedent to be actually relevant to the consequent for the implication to hold.",
  "visual_concept": "Classical: 'If pigs fly, then grass is green' is TRUE (false antecedent). Relevance logic: that's nonsense, they're unconnected!"
