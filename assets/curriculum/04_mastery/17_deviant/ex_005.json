    "Probably true",
    "Unknown/indeterminate",
    "Partially true",

  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Łukasiewicz introduced this to handle future contingents.",
  "explanation": "Three-valued logics (like Łukasiewicz's) add a third value, often interpreted as 'unknown' or 'indeterminate'. This addresses puzzles like future contingents: 'There will be a sea battle tomorrow' is neither true nor false now - it's indeterminate until tomorrow arrives.",
  "visual_concept": "True, False, and...? The third value captures statements that aren't yet determined or knowable."
