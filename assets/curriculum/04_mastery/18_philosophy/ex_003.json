  "prompt": "Conventionalism about logic claims that logical truths are:",
  "options": [
    "Discovered through empirical observation",
    "True by definition or linguistic convention",
    "Hardwired into human biology",
    "Probabilistic rather than certain"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "On this view, we made the rules of logic; they're not forced on us by reality.",
  "explanation": "Conventionalism holds that logical truths are true by virtue of how we use language - they're implicit definitions of logical words. 'P ∨ ¬P' is true because that's what 'or' and 'not' mean by our conventions. We could have chosen different conventions.",
  "visual_concept": "Logic as the rules of a game we invented. We defined 'or' to work this way; different definitions = different 'logics'."
}
