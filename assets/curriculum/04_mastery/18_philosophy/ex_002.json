  "prompt": "Logical realism holds that logical truths are:",
  "options": [
    "Human conventions that could be different",
    "Objective facts independent of human thought",
    "Psychological generalizations about reasoning",
    "Useful fictions with no real basis"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Realists think we discover logical truths, not invent them.",
  "explanation": "Logical realism holds that logical truths are objective, mind-independent facts. We discover that 'P ∨ ¬P' is true; we don't make it true by convention. Plato's theory of Forms is an early version - logical truths exist in an abstract realm we access through reason.",
  "visual_concept": "Mathematical/logical truths as eternal: 2+2=4 was true before humans, and would be true if we never existed."
