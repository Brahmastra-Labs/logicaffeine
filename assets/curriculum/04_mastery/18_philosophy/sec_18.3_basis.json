      "term": "Conventionalism",
      "definition": "The view that logical truths are true by linguistic convention — they're rules we've adopted for how to use words like 'and,' 'or,' 'not,' and 'if-then.'"
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The problem with conventionalism: logic seems to be used in establishing conventions, so it can't itself be merely conventional. We need logic to agree on the conventions."
