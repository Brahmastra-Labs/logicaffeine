  "prompt": "A fish is an animal that lives mainly in the water.",
  "options": [
    "Too broad",
    "Too narrow",
    "Circular",
    "Uses poorly understood terms",
    "Poor match in vagueness",
    "Poor match in emotional tone",
    "Has non-essential properties"
  ],
  "correct": 0,
  "hint": "Can you think of any water-dwelling animals that AREN'T fish? Would this definition accidentally include them?",
  "explanation": "This definition captures TOO MUCH. Whales, dolphins, and otters all 'live mainly in water' but aren't fish. The definition fails to exclude things that shouldn't be included. A better definition would specify what MAKES something a fish (cold-blooded, gills, scales) rather than just where it lives."
