  "id": "Q_3.1",
  "type": "multiple_choice",
  "difficulty": 1,
  "prompt": "Science is that cold and empty worship of experiments.",
  "options": [
    "Too broad",
    "Too narrow",
    "Circular",
    "Uses poorly understood terms",
    "Poor match in vagueness",
    "Poor match in emotional tone",
    "Has non-essential properties"
  ],
  "correct": 5,
  "hint": "Does this definition describe Science neutrally, or does it judge Science? Would a scientist agree this captures what they do?",
  "explanation": "The words 'cold', 'empty', and 'worship' carry strong negative emotional connotations. A good definition should describe what something IS, not how someone FEELS about it. Rule 6 states: A definition should match the emotional tone of the term being defined. Science itself is a neutral term, but this definition drips with disdain — that's a mismatch!",
  "visual_concept": "A balance scale: the neutral word 'Science' on one side, the definition dripping with negative words (cold, empty) on the other. The scale tips because the emotional weights don't match."
