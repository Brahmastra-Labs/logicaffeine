  "hint": "Is the 'if...then' itself necessary, or is it a regular conditional connecting two necessity claims?",
  "explanation": "This connects two necessity statements with a regular conditional: 'IF (\u25a1A) THEN (\u25a1B)'. Each \u25a1 wraps its own proposition. Compare to \u25a1(A \u2283 B) which would make the implication itself necessary."
