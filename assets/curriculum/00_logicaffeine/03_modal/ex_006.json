  "hint": "If something 'isn't necessary', does that mean it's false, or just that it doesn't HAVE to be true?",
  "explanation": "'Not necessary' means: there's at least one possible world where this is false. We write ~\u25a1P. This is weaker than saying 'P is false' \u2014 it just means P isn't guaranteed. In fact, P might still be true in the actual world!"
