  "options": [
    "all B is not C",
    "B is not C",
    "some B is not C",

  "hint": "Reread the sentence carefully: WHO is being talked about? Is it biologists, or non-biologists? What is being said about them?",
  "explanation": "This is tricky! The sentence says 'People who AREN'T biologists aren't clean.' It's making a claim about NON-biologists (let's call them B for short — the class of non-biologists). The claim: none of them are clean. So: 'no B is C'. Watch out for double negatives in English — they can flip meaning!"
