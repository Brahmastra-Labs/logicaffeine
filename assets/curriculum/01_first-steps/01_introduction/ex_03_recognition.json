  "options": [
    "Runs(Alice)",
    "Alice(Runs)",

  "hint": "Think of it like a function call in programming: which is the function (action), and which is the input (person)?",
  "explanation": "In logic, predicates work like functions: Runs(Alice) means 'apply the RUNS predicate to ALICE'. The predicate (action/property) comes first, then the subject goes in parentheses. Alice(Runs) would mean 'apply Alice to Runs' — but Alice isn't a predicate! And 'Runs ∧ Alice' treats them as separate propositions, losing the connection between Alice and running."
