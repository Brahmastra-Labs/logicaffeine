  "prompt": "What is the 'problem of induction' famously posed by David Hume?",
  "options": [
    "Inductive arguments are too complex to understand",
    "We cannot justify induction without using induction",
    "All inductive arguments are fallacious",
    "Induction only works in mathematics"
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Hume questioned how we can justify believing the future will resemble the past.",
  "explanation": "Hume's problem: We can't justify induction deductively (the conclusion doesn't follow necessarily), and we can't justify it inductively without circularity (using induction to justify induction). Yet we rely on induction constantly! This remains a deep philosophical puzzle.",
  "visual_concept": "The sun rose every day for billions of years. Will it rise tomorrow? 'It always has' is an inductive answer - using induction to justify induction!"
