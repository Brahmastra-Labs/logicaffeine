  "options": [
    "\"is friends with\"",
    "\"is a subset of\"",
    "\"is married to\"",
    "\"is different from\""
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Partial orders are reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.",
  "explanation": "A partial order is reflexive (A ⊆ A), antisymmetric (if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then A = B), and transitive (if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C). 'Is a subset of' is the classic example. Not every pair is comparable (partial, not total).",
  "visual_concept": "Partial order: A hierarchy or tree structure where some things are 'above' others, but not everything is comparable."
