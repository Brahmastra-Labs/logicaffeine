  "prompt": "Which of these relations is symmetric?",
  "options": [
    "\"is a child of\"",
    "\"is married to\"",
    "\"is greater than\"",
    "\"admires\""
  ],
  "correct": 1,
  "hint": "Symmetric means if R(x,y) then R(y,x): ∀x∀y(R(x,y) → R(y,x))",
  "explanation": "A relation R is symmetric if whenever x relates to y, y also relates to x. 'Is married to' is symmetric - if A is married to B, then B is married to A. 'Child of', 'greater than', and 'admires' are all asymmetric.",
  "visual_concept": "Symmetric: If there's an arrow from A to B, there's also one from B to A. Like a two-way street."
