  "hint": "What does 'consistent' mean in logic? Is it saying both ARE true, or that both COULD BE true together?",
  "explanation": "Two statements are 'consistent' if there's a possible world where BOTH are true simultaneously. The diamond (◇) means 'possibly'. So ◇(M · B) says: 'It's POSSIBLE that (you're mean AND you're bitter).' This is weaker than just (M · B), which would claim they ARE both true. Consistency is about possibility, not actuality."
