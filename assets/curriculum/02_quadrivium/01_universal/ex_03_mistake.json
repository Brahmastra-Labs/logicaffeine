  "prompt": "Why is ∀x(Dog(x) ∧ Barks(x)) WRONG for 'All dogs bark'?",
  "options": [
    "It claims everything is a barking dog",
    "It uses the wrong quantifier",
    "Dog should be lowercase",
    "Barks should come before Dog"
  ],
  "correct": 0,
  "hint": "If this logic were true, would a Cat exist in this world? Would a Table? Or would everything — cats, tables, numbers — ALL have to be barking dogs?",
  "explanation": "The bug is using ∧ (AND) instead of → (IMPLIES). ∀x(Dog(x) ∧ Barks(x)) says 'For ALL things x: x is a Dog AND x Barks.' This forces EVERYTHING to be a barking dog — cats, tables, even you! The fix: ∀x(Dog(x) → Barks(x)) says 'For all x: IF x is a Dog, THEN x Barks.' Now cats can exist peacefully."
