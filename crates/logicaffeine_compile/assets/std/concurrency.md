# Concurrency Standard Library

Helpers over the built-in task and channel constructs. The prelude makes this
vocabulary available everywhere without an explicit import.

## Note
Sends every value of a sequence into a channel, in order.

## To flush (values: Seq of Int, ch: Int):
    Repeat for v in values:
        Send v into ch.
